## Visual Servoing Assignment

Edit the file `cv_control.cpp` with your changes.


#### Building
To compile your code:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To compile with real camera support (make sure you have a USB camera plugged in), you should instead run `cmake` with the `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RealCamera` option.

#### Running
Start `pumasim` in the build/ directory.
